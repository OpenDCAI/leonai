Mycel is an enterprise-grade agent runtime that treats AI agents as long-running co-workers. Built on a middleware-first architecture, it provides the infrastructure layer missing from existing agent frameworks: sandbox isolation, multi-agent communication, and production governance.

## Why Mycel?

Existing agent frameworks focus on *building* agents. Mycel focuses on *running* them in production:

- **Middleware Pipeline**: Unified tool injection, validation, security, and observability
- **Sandbox Isolation**: Run agents in Docker/E2B/cloud with automatic state management
- **Multi-Agent Communication**: Agents discover, message, and collaborate with each other — and with humans
- **Production Governance**: Built-in security controls, audit logging, and cost tracking

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- An OpenAI-compatible API key

### 1. Get the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenDCAI/Mycel.git
cd Mycel
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Backend (Python)
uv sync

# Frontend
cd frontend/app && npm install && cd ../..
```

### 3. Start the services

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
uv run python -m backend.web.main
# → http://localhost:8001

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd frontend/app && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Open and configure

1. Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser
2. **Register** an account
3. Go to **Settings** → configure your LLM provider (API key, model)
4. Start chatting with your first agent

## Features

### Web Interface

Full-featured web platform for managing and interacting with agents:

- Real-time chat with multiple agents
- Multi-agent communication — agents message each other autonomously
- Sandbox resource dashboard
- Token usage and cost tracking
- File upload and workspace sync
- Thread history and search

### Multi-Agent Communication

Agents are first-class social entities. They can discover each other, send messages, and collaborate autonomously:

```
Member (template)
  └→ Entity (social identity — agents and humans both get one)
       └→ Thread (agent brain / conversation)
```

- **`chat_send`**: Agent A messages Agent B; B responds autonomously
- **`directory`**: Agents browse and discover other entities
- **`tell_owner`**: Agents escalate to their human owner
- **Real-time delivery**: SSE-based chat with typing indicators and read receipts

Humans also have entities — agents can initiate conversations with humans, not just the other way around.

### Middleware Pipeline

Every tool interaction flows through a 10-layer middleware stack:

```

### Sandbox Isolation

Agents run in isolated environments with managed lifecycles:

**Lifecycle**: `idle → active → paused → destroyed`

| Provider | Use Case | Cost |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Local** | Development | Free |
| **Docker** | Testing | Free |
| **E2B** | Production | $0.15/hr |
| **AgentBay** | China Region | ¥1/hr |

### MCP Integration

Connect external services via [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io):

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "github": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        "env": {"GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"},
        "allowed_tools": ["create_issue", "list_issues"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Security & Governance

- Command blacklist (rm -rf, sudo)
- Path restrictions (workspace-only)
- Extension whitelist
- Audit logging

## Architecture

**Middleware Stack**: 10-layer pipeline for unified tool management

**Sandbox Lifecycle**: `idle → active → paused → destroyed`

**Entity Model**: Member (template) → Entity (social identity) → Thread (agent brain)

**Relationships**: Member (1:N) → Thread (N:1) → Sandbox
