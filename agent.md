# Leon Agent

## Background

Leon is an AI coding assistant built with LangChain's Middleware architecture. Instead of scattered tool definitions, it uses a unified middleware pattern for tool injection, parameter validation, and result transformation.

## Goals

- Feature completeness with core tools (file operations, search, command execution, web access)
- Enterprise-ready with security controls and audit logging
- Production deployment ready
